How to add a new module release in the central maven repository ?

Help: http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/usage.html

- Launch and check if everything is ok
mvn test

-  Launch mvn verify for each module and check if it's ok
(mvn verify at the root fails with met4j-flux)


- If everything is ok: Commit everything, merge into master and push

- Run this command line to test if everything is ok
mvn --batch-mode release:prepare -DdryRun=true -Darguments=-DskipTests

- If it's ok :
mvn release:clean
mvn --batch-mode release:prepare -DdryRun=true -Darguments=-DskipTests
