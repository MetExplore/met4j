How to add a new module release in the central maven repository ?

Help: http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/usage.html

- Launch and check if everything is ok
mvn test

-  Launch mvn verify for each module and check if it's ok

- Change the version number (keep the SNAPSHOT suffix, it will be removed in the CI/CD):
mvn build-helper:parse-version versions:set -DnewVersion="0.6.0-SNAPSHOT" versions:commit

- If everything is ok: Commit everything, merge into master and push

- The gitlab CI CD will do the remain stuff.
